# About

My name is, seriously ? You still ask this ? Are you can't see my profile ? Next ! I'm a novice programmer who can only master programming languages:
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) & [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) (absolutely not a program code)
- [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
- [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) 
- [What do you expect more?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing)

I am a high school student trying to understand how to hack nasa with html to sell their secret data. Maybe that's too much. I dunno what else to say. Basically I just want to learn coding. But why am I writing this if no one will see it? stupid me!

## How to Study

Bruh, have you never studied? I study like a normal person. Read websites, books, and wanna die because of the frustration of the [**fucking errors**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error) that always appear, even though the coding is exactly **the same as the fucking tutorial**.

Sometimes, if i bored with the **fricking error**, I will make the best tea that the British will want to drink it all day long. maybe some coffee in the evening.

## Achievements 

IDK, I don't really care about my achievements, I only care about **my tea**â˜•.

## Social Media

I think nobody want to see my social media, so i will leave [blank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4JJ270xx98) here.
